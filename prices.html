<h4>More options</h4>
  <p class="large text-muted"><strong>SEO Boost <span style="color:red;">$50 per page</span></strong></p>
  <p class="large text-muted">We go through each page on your site and make sure vital SEO capabilities are optimized on your pages.
   We will help provide you with content (depending on the size of the page) and images. Also optimize your meta data and connect you
   to other SEO services to help increase online traffic.</p>
  <p class="large text-muted"><strong>Custom Integration <span style="color:red;">$75-$100</span></strong></p>
  <p class="large text-muted">Depending on what kind of integrations or additional functionality, it can vary on price. The complexity
    of the issue and the set up will vary. With so many different things out there, it is hard to give a firm price, but we will work
    with you.</p>

  <p class="large text-muted"><strong>CRM Integration <span style="color:red;">$50-$200</span></strong></p>
  <p class="large text-muted">We know how important it is to keep everything organized. We work with Deluxe Hubspot and Infusionsoft integration
     and if you want something else we can totally look into it.</p>

  <p class="large text-muted"><strong>Content Refresh <span style="color:red;">$15 per page</strong></p>
  <p class="large text-muted">Content is vital to survival. Your online presence depends on the value you can give to your visitors. All the pages
     That have 300 words or less we will help you with your content. For more extensive content work we can customize our pricing to help you.</p>
  <!-- <p class="large text-muted"><strong>Professional Pictures <span style="color:red;">$50-$1000</span></strong></p>
  <p class="large text-muted"><strong>More Logos <span style="color:red;">$10-$30</span></strong></p> -->
  <p class="large text-muted"><strong>Custom Bootstrap Site (not a CMS like Wordpress or Wix) <span style="color:red;">$1000 - $2000</span></strong></p>
  <p class="large text-muted">With a custom bootstrap site, you get to have all the design customization you want. Keep in mind that the functionality
     for a lot of the custom code has to be coded by hand and certain plug-ins are not available or more expensive. This is for you only if you have a
     very specific design in mind or if you are looking for something more complex and are wanting to build on it afterwards with a developer.</p>

        <h4>Why don't you BS your prices?</h4>
        <p class="large text-muted">Let me tell you why lil stunna. <strong>Because small businesses around the country are being taken advantage of.</strong>
           Sure you're in the business world to make money and help other people(hopefully that's how you feel...)
           ,but we don't want to rip you off, we want to help you. Therefore, we take our time with our "No BS Pricing"
           and tell you every step of the way what is happening and what we are doing to ensure you get a good looking
           site. We are flexible as far as payments, designing, and services, so if you are unsure about paying all at
           once, or are wanting more serivces, let us know.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">
        <h4>One Page Site</h4>
        <p class="large text-muted">Some businesses can get away with one page sites, depending on who your audience is
             and the amount of content you should provide for your clients. Either way we will let you know what your best
             options are. We will design it and make sure it is something you are happy with and help you develop/fiind content
             and put your site up live with your own domain and a year of hosting. Along with a month of consulting.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">
          <h4>Deluxe Package</h4>
          <p class="large text-muted">We use Wordpress as our default tool for building out websites, mostly
              because it is easy enough to use on your own. We build it then teach you the basics of what you
              need to know to run it yourself. We offer a starter and no hands maintenance kits, but ultimately
              we want you to feel free to move on with your life after the site. We will give you your own domain (unless you
              already have one) and a year of hosting.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">
            <h4>Premium Package</h4>
            <p class="large text-muted">We can use Wix or Wordpress for the design of your site and pair it with another
                service to include e-commerce abilities. We use our law of SEO to increase sales and make your site easier
                to read for search engines. We also take a look at content and meta data to optimize keywords and target
                the audience you are searching for. We also will supply you with a domain and a year of hosting. Usually with
                e-commerce, there are monthly fees that do apply, but we take it into account with our maintanence packages. </p>

             <h4>Maintenance</h4>
             <p class="large text-muted"><strong>No Hands</strong></p>
             <p class="large text-muted">No hands is exactly what it sounds like, it means you don't have to worry about it at all. You sleep while we work.
                We will manage your pages, fix bugs, add specific content or pages to your site, manage e-commerce if you got it, roll with the updates and
                offer consulting and basic SEO maintenance.</p>
              <p class="large text-muted"><strong>Starter</strong></p>
              <p class="large text-muted">Starter means that you want to eventually taper off the maintenance and run your site on your own. We send you (depending on
                 your plan) a number of training videos. They will allow you to do all the normal functionality of upkeeping on your site. We send you videos and will
                 offer basic consulting, just untill you are ready to go out on your own.</p>

                <h4>What If I Don't Do A Maintenance Package?</h4>
                <p class="large text-muted">That's totally fine, but we do want to let you know ahead of time, that a website
                   is a lot like a house. You essentially buy property (domain/website URL name), the actual house (files/hosting),
                   and then the things inside the house (SEO/content/functionality). Just like a house you have maintainence costs no matter what
                   so if you want to take it on yourself, you can. The only thing we try and make sure of is that if something breaks or you want
                   to do more, not everyone is a plumber or electrician and things can get sticky really fast so if you don't feel comfortable with that, we'll do it no sweat.</p>
